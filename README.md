## Design Philosophy

- **Not scalable. Not a product.** This is a self-contained, aesthetic, emotionally intelligent dashboard.
- **Weather metaphor**: Stormy → Cloudy → Clear → Sunny as tasks complete
- **Encouragement style**: Supportive, witty, self-aware
- **Theme**: Brain clarity, self-respect, honest progress tracking

## Key Microcopy

- "Done is allowed."
- "Storm's clearing."
- "Say it ugly, not pretty."
- "It's fine if today was 4/10. 4 is data."
